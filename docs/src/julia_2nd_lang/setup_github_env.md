# Setup Julia Repo in GitHub with Actions

## Install Julia

Basically if you are using Linux or Mac, you can easily install Julia by the package manager.
For Gentoo, we can install it with portage as following.

```shell
$ sudo emerge -av julia

```

The problem to install Julia by [Gentoo package manager](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage)
is slow upgrade speed.
In this time, July 27 2023, latest stable version version of Julia in the
[official site](https://julialang.org/downloads/) is 1.9.2 but Gentoo still has
1.8.5 as the latest one.
To overcome this gap, according to the instruction in [Julia GitHub](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia)
we can easily install it by compiling source.

```shell
$ cd localgit  <-- local git directory
$ git clone https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia.git
$ cd julia
$ git checkout v1.9.2  <-- tag for latest version
$ make
$ ln -s julia ~/.local/bin/julia  <-- This should be earlier path than /usr/bin/julia
```

## Setup Julia language server with formatter for Neovim

!!! info

    This setup is based on cloned
    [Neovim-from-scratch](https://github.com/erdosxx/Neovim-from-scratch/tree/27_Julia_REPL)
    and [Github repo: evoagile_configs](https://github.com/erdosxx/evoagile_configs) repo.

To setup LSP([Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)) with
[julials.lua](https://github.com/erdosxx/Neovim-from-scratch/blob/27_Julia_REPL/lua/user/lsp/settings/julials.lua)
file in [Neovim-from-scratch](https://github.com/erdosxx/Neovim-from-scratch/tree/27_Julia_REPL),
we need to setup `nvim-lspconfig` environment first.
Using [stow](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-admin/stow) tool,
we can copy `Makefile` to `~/.julia/environments/nvim-lspconfig/`.

```shell
$ cd localgit/evoagile_configs   <-- if your local cloned repo is in localgit
$ stow -t ~ julia
$ cd ~/.julia/environments/nvim-lspconfig/
$ make
```

After `make` command, `neovim` is launched and open `Example.jl` source file with
some errors. If you wait a moment and no problem occur to install, you can find
some bullets as following screenshot.

![Example.jl with bullets](../assets/julia_lsp_result.png)

Then just quit `neovim` and continue and finish installation.
To test installation, open any example Julia file and change keyword `function` to
`func tion` and at the same line, input `gl`. If you have some bullets and
messages as following, your installation is successful.
![Success to install](../assets/julia_lsp_install_success.png)

If you have any error to load Julia LSP, you can find following errror message in `neovim`.
![Fail message](../assets/julia_lsp_error.png)

As you can find in the following, `LanguageServer` package depends on
`JuliaFormatter`, `StaticLint`, and `SymbolServer`. That means we do not have to
install `JuliaFormatter` separately.

```@example
using Pkg
Pkg.add("LanguageServer")

```

To format your code, you can find related commends in
[keymaps.lua](https://github.com/erdosxx/Neovim-from-scratch/blob/27_Julia_REPL/lua/user/keymaps.lua)
file. Type `:Format` in command or `<space key>f`(when `<localleader>` = `<space key>`)
in normal mode, whole code in the file will be formatted.

!!! info

    To get supported to Julia formatting, we can also try to use
    [JuliaFormatter.vim](https://github.com/kdheepak/JuliaFormatter.vim).
    This only supports formatting and no other LSP function but
    range format supporting in visual mode and
    definition of format option in configuration file are possible.
    This uses [JuliaFormatter](https://github.com/domluna/JuliaFormatter.jl)
    independently.
    However, I found that when we use Julia LSP with this package, LSP was
    crashed occasionally. So I decided to uninstall it.

To define format parameters in Julia code is not easy in
[LSP configuration file](https://github.com/erdosxx/Neovim-from-scratch/blob/27_Julia_REPL/lua/user/lsp/settings/julials.lua).
The solution is use ['.JuliaFormatter.toml'](https://domluna.github.io/JuliaFormatter.jl/dev/config/)
file in every repo. So it can be convenient to add this file to
PkgTemplates. (See below section)

!!! info

    The useful configuration to format is
    - style = "sciml"
    - indent = 2
    - margin = 79
    For style options, see [YAS](https://domluna.github.io/JuliaFormatter.jl/dev/yas_style/),
    [Blue](https://domluna.github.io/JuliaFormatter.jl/dev/blue_style/), and
    [SciML](https://domluna.github.io/JuliaFormatter.jl/dev/sciml_style/).

## Use [PkgTemplates](https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgTemplates.jl) to generate repository

PkgTemplates simplifies the process of setting up the initial file structure for
a new repository, specifically [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
integration with GitHub actions.
To use PkgTemplates, we recommend to install it in system default Julia environment,
for example, `v1.9` as following.

```@example
using Pkg
Pkg.activate()    <-- Use system default env
Pkg.add("PkgTemplates")
```

After installing it, we need to setup the template. It would be convenient to keep it
in the
[`startup.jl`](https://github.com/erdosxx/evoagile_configs/blob/master/julia/.julia/config/startup.jl)
file for easy reuse.
